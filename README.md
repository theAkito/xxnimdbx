## ++NimDBX

This project is the successor to the now archived Nim wrapper for [libmdbx](https://abf.io/erthink/libmdbx), [NimDBX](https://github.com/snej/nimdbx).

For all information regarding how NimDBX works, its history, etc., check out [upstream](https://github.com/snej/nimdbx).

The master purpose of this fork is to keep this Nim project alive, as there currently is no equal or otherwise viable alternative available.

99% of the effort was accomplished by [Jens Alfke](https://github.com/snej).
All I did, was updating [libmdbx](https://abf.io/erthink/libmdbx) to version 0.12.8, porting this project to Nim 2.0.0 and [fixing Nimterop just enough](https://github.com/theAkito/xxnimterop) to keep this project alive.
